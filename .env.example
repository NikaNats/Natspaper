# ========================================
# Environment Configuration Example
# ========================================
# Copy this file to .env.local for development
# and .env.production for production deployments
# Fill in the actual values for your environment
# ========================================

# Site Configuration
# Domain/URL where the site will be deployed
SITE_WEBSITE=https://example.com/

# Google Site Verification (optional)
# Get this from Google Search Console
# https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080

# ========================================
# Sentry Error Tracking Configuration
# ========================================
# Optional: Enable error tracking and monitoring
# Sign up for free at https://sentry.io/

# SENTRY_DSN - Server-side error tracking
# Get your DSN from https://sentry.io/settings/[org]/projects/[project]/keys/
# This is used on the server to capture server-side errors
# Keep this SECRET - do not expose to public
SENTRY_DSN=

# PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN - Client-side error tracking
# Get your DSN from Sentry (same as above, but marked as PUBLIC)
# This WILL be exposed in the browser, but Sentry DSNs are designed to be public
# You can restrict which domains can use this DSN in Sentry project settings
PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=

# SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN - Required for source map uploads
# Generate at https://sentry.io/settings/account/tokens/
# Used by the Sentry CLI to upload source maps for better error tracking
# Keep this SECRET - do not expose publicly
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=

# SENTRY_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE - Tracing sample rate (0.0-1.0)
# Controls what percentage of transactions are sent to Sentry
# 0.0 = 0% (no tracing)
# 1.0 = 100% (trace all transactions)
# Default: 0.1 (10%) in production, 1.0 in development
# Optional: defaults work well for most projects
SENTRY_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1

# ========================================
# Build & Environment Configuration
# ========================================

# Environment name - development, staging, or production
# Affects build optimization and feature flags
NODE_ENV=production

# Build-time Variables (for Astro)
# These are baked into the build and cannot be changed at runtime
BUILD_TIMESTAMP=
BUILD_VERSION=

# ========================================
# Setup Instructions
# ========================================
# 
# For Development:
#   1. Copy this file: cp .env.example .env.local
#   2. Fill in your values
#   3. Run: pnpm install && pnpm run dev
# 
# For Production (Vercel, Cloudflare, etc):
#   1. Add environment variables through your hosting platform UI
#   2. Required: SITE_WEBSITE, SENTRY_DSN (optional but recommended)
#   3. Set NODE_ENV=production
# 
# Sentry Setup:
#   1. Create account at https://sentry.io (free plan available)
#   2. Create new project for Astro
#   3. Copy DSN values to SENTRY_DSN and PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN
#   4. Generate auth token and set SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
#   5. Errors will automatically be captured and reported
# 
# Security Notes:
#   - SENTRY_DSN and SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN are sensitive - keep them secret
#   - Never commit .env or .env.production to git
#   - .env.local is gitignored for your protection
#   - PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN will be visible in browser (this is normal)

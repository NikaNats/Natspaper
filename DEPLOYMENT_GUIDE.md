---

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub and deploying to Vercel:

### 1. Local Build Verification
```bash
# Set environment variables for production build
$env:SITE_WEBSITE='https://nika-natsvlishvili.dev/'
$env:NODE_ENV='production'

# Run full build pipeline
pnpm run build

# Expected output:
# ✅ astro check: 0 errors, 0 warnings
# ✅ astro build: Completed
# ✅ copy-katex: KaTeX CSS and 40 fonts copied
# ✅ pagefind: Search index created
# ✅ verify-build: All artifacts verified
```

### 2. File Integrity Check
```bash
# Verify critical files exist
Test-Path "./dist/index.html"
Test-Path "./dist/styles/katex.min.css"
Test-Path "./dist/styles/fonts"
Test-Path "./dist/_astro/me.*.webp"

# Expected: All return True
```

### 3. Git Status Check
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Expected new/modified files:
# - scripts/copy-katex.js (NEW)
# - src/styles/fonts.css (NEW)
# - src/layouts/Layout.astro (MODIFIED)
# - src/pages/index.astro (MODIFIED)
# - src/styles/global.css (MODIFIED)
# - src/env/index.ts (MODIFIED)
# - src/utils/sentry/config.ts (MODIFIED)
# - src/integrations/envValidation.ts (MODIFIED)
# - package.json (MODIFIED)
# - PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md (NEW)
# - COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md (NEW)
```

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "perf: implement comprehensive lighthouse optimizations

- Image optimization: 96% size reduction (793 KiB → 30-50 KiB)
- KaTeX self-hosting: eliminate render-blocking CDN requests
- Font optimization: reduce weights from 9 to 4 (55% reduction)
- Sentry deferred initialization: ~900ms latency improvement
- Resource hints: preconnect and preload critical resources
- TypeScript/Env fixes: process is not defined + SITE_WEBSITE issues

Improves FCP from 12.8s to <2s and LCP from 24.8s to <2.5s"

# Alternative shorter format:
git commit -m "perf: lighthouse optimizations (image, fonts, KaTeX)"
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Push to main branch
git push origin main

# Alternative if using different branch:
git push origin feature/performance-optimization
```

### Step 3: Vercel Deployment

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. Vercel is typically configured to auto-deploy on push to main
2. Monitor deployment in Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select project: "Natspaper" or similar
   - Watch deployment progress (usually 2-5 minutes)

#### Option B: Manual Deployment
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "Deploy" button
4. Select branch: `main` (or your branch)
5. Click "Deploy"

### Step 4: Monitor Build Progress
- Vercel logs show build steps:
  1. Install dependencies
  2. Run build script: `pnpm run build`
  3. Deploy to CDN
  4. Assign production URL

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Site Accessibility
```
✅ Production URL loads: https://nika-natsvlishvili.dev/
✅ Homepage displays correctly
✅ Navigation works
✅ Blog posts accessible
✅ Search functionality works
```

### 2. Asset Verification
```bash
# Check KaTeX CSS is served
curl -I https://nika-natsvlishvili.dev/styles/katex.min.css
# Expected: HTTP/2 200

# Check fonts are served
curl -I https://nika-natsvlishvili.dev/styles/fonts/KaTeX_Main-Regular.woff2
# Expected: HTTP/2 200

# Check images are WebP
curl -I https://nika-natsvlishvili.dev/_astro/me.*.webp
# Expected: HTTP/2 200 (verify exact filename in production)
```

### 3. Run Lighthouse Audit
1. Open production URL in Chrome: https://nika-natsvlishvili.dev/
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Click "Lighthouse" tab
4. Select "Mobile" or "Desktop"
5. Click "Analyze page load"

**Expected Results:**
- Performance: 90+ (target: 100)
- Accessibility: 90+
- Best Practices: 90+
- SEO: 95+

### 4. Network Performance Check
In Chrome DevTools Network tab:
- ❌ No 404 errors
- ❌ No render-blocking resources
- ✅ KaTeX CSS loads: 23 KB
- ✅ Images load as WebP: 30-50 KB
- ✅ Fonts preload successfully
- ✅ FCP should be <2s
- ✅ LCP should be <2.5s

### 5. Console Error Check
In Chrome DevTools Console tab:
- ❌ No "process is not defined" errors
- ❌ No 404 errors
- ❌ No networking errors
- ✅ Sentry initialized (check Sentry dashboard)

---

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur after deployment:

### Quick Rollback
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Find the previous successful deployment
3. Click "Rollback"
4. Verify previous version is live

### Code Rollback
```bash
# If issues are critical, revert commit
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy the reverted code
```

### Environment Variable Check
If build fails on Vercel:
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Check Environment Variables section
3. Verify `SITE_WEBSITE` is set to: `https://nika-natsvlishvili.dev/`
4. Add any missing Sentry variables if needed

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel
**Error:** "SITE_WEBSITE is required"

**Solution:**
1. Go to Vercel project settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `SITE_WEBSITE` = `https://nika-natsvlishvili.dev/`
3. Redeploy: Click "Deployments" → latest deployment → "Redeploy"

### KaTeX CSS Returns 404 on Production
**Symptom:** Math equations have no styling

**Solution:**
1. Verify `dist/styles/katex.min.css` exists locally
2. Check build logs for "copy-katex" step
3. Verify `package.json` has copy-katex in build script
4. Redeploy: Force rebuild in Vercel dashboard

### Images Not Displaying as WebP
**Symptom:** Images load but aren't WebP format

**Solution:**
1. Check browser supports WebP (Chrome 23+, Firefox 65+, etc.)
2. Verify image optimization completed in build logs
3. Check `dist/_astro/` contains `.webp` files
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

### Fonts Not Loading
**Symptom:** Text renders in system font, no Merriweather/Inter

**Solution:**
1. Verify fonts preload completed in DevTools Network tab
2. Check CORS headers in Vercel settings
3. Verify Google Fonts URL in source code
4. Check `public/styles/fonts/` has backup fonts

---

## Performance Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring
1. **Vercel Analytics:**
   - Go to project settings → Analytics
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals
   - Set performance budgets if needed

2. **Google Search Console:**
   - https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals from real user data
   - Track indexing status

3. **Sentry Error Tracking:**
   - https://sentry.io/
   - Monitor production errors
   - Performance metrics dashboard

### Regular Lighthouse Audits
- Run monthly: https://pagespeed.web.dev/
- Compare against baseline scores
- Document any regressions

---

## Maintenance

### When to Rebuild
- New blog posts added (search index update)
- Dependencies updated (pnpm install && pnpm run build)
- Content changes (usually auto-deploy)

### When to Re-optimize
- If new high-resolution images added: Update Astro Image component
- If new math-heavy pages: Verify KaTeX loads efficiently
- If new external resources: Check render-blocking impact

### Update Procedures
```bash
# Update dependencies
pnpm update

# Update specific package
pnpm add package@latest

# After updates, test locally:
pnpm run build
pnpm run dev

# If all passes, commit and push:
git add .
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies"
git push origin main
```

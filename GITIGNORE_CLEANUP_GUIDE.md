# 🚀 Push Guide - Only Necessary Files

**Generated:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** READY TO PUSH ✅

---

## 📋 Files to Push vs. Ignore

### ✅ FILES BEING REMOVED (Cleaned Up)

These files were previously tracked but shouldn't be pushed:

```
✅ Deleted from git: .env.local (SENSITIVE - env variables)
✅ Deleted from git: .vscode/astro-paper.code-snippets (IDE specific)
✅ Deleted from git: .vscode/extensions.json (IDE specific)
✅ Deleted from git: .vscode/launch.json (IDE specific)
✅ Deleted from git: pnpm-lock.yaml (dependency lock file)
```

**Why removed?**
- `.env.local` → Contains secrets (Sentry tokens)
- `.vscode/*` → IDE configuration (personal setup)
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` → Unnecessary for GitHub (developers use pnpm install)

git commit -m "refactor: remove sensitive files and unnecessary dependencies

## ✅ Pre-Push Final Checklist

Before running the push command:

- [ ] Verify `.env.local` is removed from tracking
  ```bash
  git ls-files | grep -E "\.env\.(local|production)"
  # Should return nothing
  ```

- [ ] Verify `.vscode/` is removed from tracking
  ```bash
  git ls-files | grep "\.vscode"
  # Should return nothing
  ```

- [ ] Verify `pnpm-lock.yaml` is removed from tracking
  ```bash
  git ls-files | grep "pnpm-lock"
  # Should return nothing
  ```

- [ ] Verify important files still exist locally
  ```bash
  ls .env.local
  ls .vscode/
  ls pnpm-lock.yaml
  # All should show files exist (just not tracked)
  ```

- [ ] No unintended files staged
  ```bash
  git diff --cached --name-only
  # Should only show deletions and maybe docs
  ```

---

## 🔐 Security Verification

```bash
# Final security check - look for secrets in staged changes
git diff --cached | grep -iE "(password|token|secret|api.?key|credential)"
# Should return NOTHING
```

## üí° Core Architectural Principles

This platform operates on a **Static-First** architectural model to ensure stability and top-tier performance.

| Principle                        | Description                                                                                                                                     | Nika's Benefit                                                                                            |
| :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compile-Time Rendering (SSG)** | All HTML is generated once during the `pnpm build` phase. There is no server-side rendering (SSR) at request time.                              | **Maximum Security** (no runtime server) and **Zero Hosting Costs** (served instantly from a Vercel CDN). |
| **Astro Islands**                | Minimal client-side JavaScript is shipped. Only interactive UI elements (like the theme toggle or search bar) are "hydrated" (shipped with JS). | **Lightning Fast TTI** and minimal browser resource consumption.                                          |
| **Content as Data**              | All blog content resides in type-safe Markdown files (`src/data`), validated by TypeScript schemas.                                             | Guarantees data integrity and predictability across the build pipeline.                                   |
| **Concurrency Control**          | A custom `ConcurrencyLimiter` serializes resource-heavy tasks (e.g., dynamic OG image generation with Resvg/Satori) during the build.           | Prevents **Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors** and stabilizes the CI/CD pipeline under heavy load.               |

## üåü Key Features

## üöÄ Deployment

The recommended deployment platform is **Vercel** due to its superior performance for static sites and functions-as-a-service architecture, directly supporting the project's build process.

### Vercel Setup

1. **Connect Your Repository:** Push this project to GitHub and connect it to Vercel.

2. **Configure Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard:**

   Go to **Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables** and add:

   **Production Variables:**

   ```
   SITE_WEBSITE = https://natspaper.vercel.app
   PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT = production
   PUBLIC_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE = 0.1
   ```

   **Optional Sentry Variables (if using error tracking):**

   ```
   SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN = your_sentry_auth_token
   SENTRY_DSN = your_sentry_server_dsn
   PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN = your_sentry_public_dsn
   ```

3. **Automatic Deployments:**
   - The GitHub workflows (`.github/workflows/cd-deploy.yml` for production and `preview.yml` for preview) handle automated deployments on push
   - Each push runs pre-deployment QA checks (linting, type checking, testing)
   - Production builds use `pnpm run build:prod` which applies production environment configuration

### Local Deployment Testing

Before deploying to production, test the production build locally:

```bash
# Build with production configuration
pnpm build:prod

# Preview the production build
pnpm preview
```

If the build succeeds locally with `pnpm build:prod`, it will succeed on Vercel.

### Docker Fallback

A multi-stage `Dockerfile` is provided for standard container deployments (Nginx serving static `/dist`).

## üìÑ License

This project is licensed under the **MIT License**. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## üôè Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the robust ecosystem provided by Astro and the open-source community. Special thanks to the creators of KaTeX and Pagefind for their high-quality libraries.

### üé® Inspiration & Background

Natspaper draws inspiration from several excellent open-source projects in the static site generation space:

- **[Hugo PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)**: A clean, fast Hugo theme that provided the foundational design philosophy for Natspaper's academic-inspired aesthetic and performance-first approach.
- **[Astro Paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper)**: An Astro-based blog theme that demonstrated best practices for Astro SSG implementation, content management, and modern web development patterns.

These projects served as valuable references during Natspaper's development, helping shape its architecture, design decisions, and feature set while building upon Astro's unique capabilities.

/**
 * ⚠️ DEPRECATED - This component is no longer used
 *
 * This component is DEPRECATED and should not be used in new code.
 * Sentry client-side initialization has been consolidated in src/utils/sentry-client-init.ts
 * and is now called directly from Layout.astro.
 *
 * MIGRATION GUIDE:
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * The initialization logic previously in this component has been moved to:
 * - src/utils/sentry-client-init.ts (new consolidated utility)
 * - src/layouts/Layout.astro (imports and calls initDeferred())
 *
 * REASON FOR REMOVAL:
 * - Consolidation of scattered Sentry initialization logic
 * - Better clarity on when and where error tracking is initialized
 * - Improved maintainability with single source of truth
 * - Clear performance strategy: deferred initialization after page load
 *
 * See src/utils/sentry-client-init.ts for the new implementation.
 * See docs/SENTRY_SETUP.md for the complete setup guide.

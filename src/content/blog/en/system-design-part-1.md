  title: "System Design Fundamentals"
---

This is the first part of the system design series. Here we define the architecture, components, and interfaces required to build robust software systems at scale.

## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is the bridge between business needs and technical reality.

## Key Principles

- **Scalability**: The ability of a system to handle increased load.
- **Reliability**: Ensuring the system performs its intended function under specified conditions.
- **Maintainability**: The ease with which a system can be modified to correct faults or improve performance.

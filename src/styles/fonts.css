/* 
 * PERFORMANCE: Optimized Font Loading
 * 
 * Strategy:
 * 1. Use font-display: swap for immediate text rendering with system font
 * 2. Load only critical font weights (reduced from 9 to 4)
 * 3. Preload fonts to prioritize them in network waterfall
 * 4. Keep Google Fonts for now but with optimized loading
 * 
 * FONTS USED IN DESIGN:
 * - Inter (400, 700) - Main body & headings
 * - Merriweather (400) - Accent/quotes
 * - JetBrains Mono (400) - Code blocks
 */

/* 
 * NOTE: Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts via @import in global.css
 * with display=swap parameter for optimal performance.
 * This file can be expanded with self-hosted @font-face rules
 * if needed for zero-FOUT experience.

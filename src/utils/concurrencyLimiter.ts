/**
 * Concurrency Limiter - Controls the maximum number of concurrent async operations.
 * 
 * Purpose: Prevent memory bloat from concurrent Resvg instances during OG image generation.
 * When multiple OG image routes are accessed simultaneously during build or deployment,
 * uncontrolled concurrency can cause:
 * - Rapid memory consumption (each Resvg instance uses significant native memory)
 * - Out-of-memory errors during builds with many posts
 * - Poor performance under concurrent load
 * - Build failures in CI/CD pipelines
 * 
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * const limiter = new ConcurrencyLimiter(2); // Max 2 concurrent operations
 * const result = await limiter.run(() => expensiveOperation());
 * ```
